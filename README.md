# Etch-a-Sketch

### Purpose
This is my approach to the Etch-a-Sketch project assigned by The Odin Project.

### Features
- Mouse drawing box
- Select a color
- Random colors
- Clear work
- Pixel size change

### Reflection
This project was extremely cumulative relating to all of the topics The Odin Project has touched on before.  Using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS, I was able to practice my abilities working with DOMs and continue to produce clean code.  It was very exciting to build this project from the ground up and witness the development stages.
